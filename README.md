### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I started on my professional journey in IT support, transitioning to software development in 2018. Initially, working with Java and JSF. Subsequently, I joined a different company as a Fullstack Developer, where I expanded my expertise to include Java EE and frameworks such as Spring Boot and Quarkus, coupled with Vue.js on the frontend.

Since 2021, I have been dedicated to backend development, primarily utilizing Python and Java within the AWS ecosystem. My responsibilities encompass a range of AWS services, including EC2, ECS, Lambda Functions, RDS, DynamoDB, and more. Throughout my career, I've consistently collaborated with internal and junior developers, fostering an environment of shared learning and growth.
